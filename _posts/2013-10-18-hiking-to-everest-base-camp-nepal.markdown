No trip to Nepal is complete without experiencing the journey to Everest Base Camp! The adventure began as soon as I walked through the entrance of Lukla Airport, the start of the hike. The views were breathtaking and the adrenaline was kicking in; I was ready to make my way to the base camp! The trek was long but the views along the way made it worth it. As I reached the final destination, I was in complete awe of the view in front of me. It was unlike any other place I have ever been before.
