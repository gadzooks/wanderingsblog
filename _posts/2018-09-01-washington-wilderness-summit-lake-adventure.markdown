I recently had the pleasure of embarking on a summit lake backpacking adventure in Washington State. After a few hours of hiking, I arrived at the lake and was in awe of its beauty. The sun was shining, the water was crystal clear, and the surrounding mountains were breathtaking. I spent the day exploring the area, taking in the stunning views, and enjoying the peacefulness of the lake. I even had the chance to go for a swim! It was an unforgettable experience and I can't wait to go backpacking in Washington again.
