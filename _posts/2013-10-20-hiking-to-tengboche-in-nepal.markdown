My experience hiking to Everest Base Camp was one of the most amazing experiences of my life. From starting my journey in Nepal to the breathtaking views of Tengboche, every moment was breathtaking. The hike was never ending and challenging, but the feeling of arriving at my destination made it all worth it in the end. Although it was a tough adventure to take on, I would do it again in a heartbeat!
