I recently hiked Miller Peak in the Teanaway area and it was an amazing experience! My trusty pup Baloo and I hiked the peak which was carpeted with snow at the top. Although the climb and descent was a bit rough, I was rewarded with some breathtaking and beautiful views. It was the perfect way to start the new year - I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to explore the area!
