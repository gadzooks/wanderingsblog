On December 14th, 2014, I decided to make a special trip to Mt Rainier. I wanted to experience all of its unique winter offerings, so I set up a morning at the base and hopped on a gondola with my snowshoes for higher altitude. After disembarking, I grabbed a map and started exploring the trails.

I trekked through the fresh snow and explored nearby ridge lines while snowshoeing and hiking in the breathtaking scenery of the mountain. It was simply magical. The sound of the snow crunching beneath my feet as I forged a path through the dense brush and wind-swept trails was truly unforgettable. I can't wait to make the trek again and explore Mt Rainier in the years to come.
