Visiting Grand Prismatic Spring in Yellowstone National Park was one of the most memorable experiences of my life! With its vibrant colors of blue, yellow, purple, and green, the spring is simply breathtaking. What sets this spring apart from others is the multi-colored rings of vibrant microorganisms that decorate the surface. It was one of the few places that literally took my breath away, and I was mesmerized by its beauty for hours.
