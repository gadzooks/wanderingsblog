Yesterday, I had the incredible opportunity to hike up Bandera Mountain in Washington State. It had been something that I had wanted to do for a while now and I'm so glad I got to share this experience with my friend Phil.

The sunset hike was breathtaking--literally. We made it up just in time to see the sun sink below the tree line. As we admired the incredible view from the top of the mountain, I couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction for having made it to the summit. It was definitely an experience I will never forget.
