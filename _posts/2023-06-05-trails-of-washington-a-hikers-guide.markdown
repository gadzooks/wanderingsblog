I recently hiked up Bandera Mountain in Washington State with my friend Phil. The views up top were spectacular, with a 360 degree panoramic of the surrounding landscape, and it was an enjoyable and fairly easy trail. It was especially enjoyable around sunset as we soaked in the vibrant oranges and pinks of the sky.

We opted for the longer but less steep hiking path and took our time admiring the wildlife while snacking on some local trail mix. We also kept a leisurely pace so we could share conversation and laugh about old times. The evening ended on a high point, with soothing melodies of nature and an extraordinary painted sky â€“ which made for a wonderful hiking experience with my friend Phil.
