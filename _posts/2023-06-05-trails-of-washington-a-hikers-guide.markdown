I recently spent an adventurous day hiking with my friend Phil and our beloved pet Baloo in Bandera Mountain, Washington State. The entire trail was lined with old-growth trees, wildflowers and in the backdrop, the gorgeous Cascades mountain range. We chose to embark on our journey in the evening as we wanted to watch the sunset while we hiked.

The entire hike was filled with adventure. Baloo, my canine companion did not show signs of fatigue and loved the entire journey. Though the climb was rocky, the result was worth it. The sun was painting the sky with a canvas of oranges and golds as we reached the top. The view we were able to witness was pure bliss.
