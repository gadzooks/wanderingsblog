I recently went on an amazing hike in Washington State. The amount of beauty that can be seen in one day was jaw-dropping. Everywhere you look, there are mountains and evergreen trees. We hiked up a few slopes to get some amazing views, along the way, we encountered various wildlife which was very exciting. In total, we hiked about 5 miles and it was definitely the highlight of my trip to Washington State. I highly recommend planning a hiking trip if you ever find yourself visiting this part of the country!
