One of the most magical experiences available in Seward, Alaska is whale watching. With the stunning views of the sea, mountains, and glaciers, whale watching here is a truly majestic experience. If you're lucky, you just might spot a whale breach! Seeing a whale at full size as it pokes its enormous head out of the water is a sight that will stay with you forever. Seward's whale watching is an experience that simply can't be missed!
