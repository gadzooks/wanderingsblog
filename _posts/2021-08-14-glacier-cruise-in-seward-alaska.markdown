I had the luck to travel to Alaska recently, and it was one of the most breathtaking experiences I have ever had. I started my trip in the beautiful city of Seward, where I took a day-long cruise via a glacier. The views were indescribably beautiful, and I drank in all of the gorgeous, glistening blue hues of the glacier and the shore. Even though Alaska was colder than I had anticipated, it was worth it to see the incredible beauty of nature that this place has to offer.
