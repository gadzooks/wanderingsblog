My morning started early, with the sun just peeking over Grand Teton in the distance. There's nothing quite like a morning hike around Jenny Lake. I was excited to start my journey along the lakeside, surrounded by the picturesque mountain range. As I rounded the lake, I was in awe of the crystal clear water. Taking a short break on a rock along the shoreline I took in the stunning beauty of the lake and its surroundings. I couldn't think of a better way to start my morning.
