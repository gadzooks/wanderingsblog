Skyline lake snowshoe is an amazing snowshoe by Stevens Pass East. It has incredible views, a frozen lake (depending on time of the year) and a beautiful rock garden at the top.

Make sure to get there early enough since parking can be limited at the Stevens Pass parking lot (just east of the pass).

See <a href="https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/skyline-lake-snowshoe" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/skyline-lake-snowshoe</a> for more details.
<p class='caution_note'>Note: Remember to check the weather conditions and carry essential hiking gear, 
        including water, snacks, and appropriate clothing, before setting off on any hiking adventure. </p>
