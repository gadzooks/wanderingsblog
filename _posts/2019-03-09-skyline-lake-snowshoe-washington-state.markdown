Skyline lake snowshoe is an amazing snowshoe by Stevens Pass East. It has incredible views, a frozen lake (depending on time of the year) and a beautiful rock garden at the top.

Make sure to get there early enough since parking can be limited at the Stevens Pass parking lot (just east of the pass).
