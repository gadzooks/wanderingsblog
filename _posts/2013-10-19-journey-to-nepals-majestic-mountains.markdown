Hiking to Everest Base Camp in Nepal was an adventure unlike any other. Every day presented a new vista of beautiful mountains like Amadablam, and it felt like being in a world where beautiful mountains were everywhere you looked. The journey to reach Everest Base Camp was challenging, but the breathtaking views of nature more than made up for it.
