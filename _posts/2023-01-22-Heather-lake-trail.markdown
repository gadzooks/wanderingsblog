Heather Lake Trail is a stunning 4.5 mile out-and-back trail located in Washington State. Situated along the western slopes of the Cascade Mountains, this enchanted hike winds through majestic old-growth forest, past a breathtaking alpine lake, and offers views of jagged peaks, lush meadows, and tall evergreen trees. While the entirety of the hike is difficult and rocky, it is worth the effort as hikers are rewarded with stunning views of the surrounding mountains. Wildlife is abundant throughout the hike including deer, bear, and osprey. Bring a camera and plenty of water as the hike can be quite strenuous due to the altitude and terrain.
