My adventure to the Everest Base Camp started in Tengboche, Nepal. From there I began my hike to the the legendary mountain of Everest. During my journey I took in the gorgeous sights of the Himalayas Mountains and enjoyed the scenery of the lush, green forests. After several days of hiking, I made it, Everest Base Camp. The view of the mountains absolutely blew me away and was like nothing I have ever seen before. I am truly grateful for this amazing experience and grateful to have had the chance to take on this amazing journey.
