>This was my first "solo" backpacking adventure. I decided to go on a long 4 day hike in the North Cascades and I picked a tough scenic one - [North Fork Sauk Trail](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/white-pass-pilot-ridge-loop){:target="_blank"}

Some of the things that made this very challenging were : 
- My first solo trip
- It was about 30 miles, in high country and it was a hot summer week.
- I had no idea that Baloo gets so hot and needs a lot of water himself.
