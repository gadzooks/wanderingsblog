My trip to Alaska was definitely one of the most incredible experiences of my life! I traveled across the Kenai peninsula and encountered wildlife I could only dream of seeing. I got to observe puffins gracefully flying across the water, bald eagles soaring through the sky, and sea otters lounging on the beach. I will never forget the wonder of these wild places and the memories I made while I was there.
