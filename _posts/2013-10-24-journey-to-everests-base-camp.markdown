Exploring the majestic, snow-capped mountains around Everest Base Camp in Nepal was one of the most unforgettable experiences of my life. The mountain village of Gorak Shep, tucked away between two mountain peaks, was especially astonishing. The locals were incredibly hospitable and the views were breathtaking. I would highly recommend anyone heading to Nepal to make the extra effort and take the trek to Everest Base Camp - it is an experience you will never forget!
