My 2017 winter hike to Lake Serene was definitely one of the most memorable hikes I have ever done! The snow was deep and pristine, the mountains majestic, and my hiking buddies were Baloo (my trusty pup) and my friend Phil. It felt great to be out in the fresh winter air and take in the stunning scenery and do something adventurous. Every inch of that trail was beautiful and I can't wait to go back soon!
