> We drove from Seattle to Yellowstone and entered from the northern entrance where we saw the Mammoth Hot Springs and a lot of wild life.

### Some of the highlights of the day were : 

#### Rivers of Yellowstone
This one was an unexpected and pleasant surprise for us. We had no idea about the beauty and serenity of the river system in Yellowstone. I could have spent a few days taking pictures and drawing them if I could. Something to do on a longer visit some day üòÑ

#### Bon Fire !!
This was on our way back to the AirBnb. **Remind me to link the lovely place we stayed at.** We were heading back when we saw these huge flames in the distance. As we drove closer we saw a **huge** communal bon fire which was about 2-3 storey high. There were a lot of people around it, having a great time. I wish I had had my better camera / lens, but these are the pictures I captured from a distance. It was one of those sights where you had to stop by the side of the road and take some pictures üòÑ
