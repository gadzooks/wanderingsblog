I recently had the opportunity to spend a three-day memorial weekend in beautiful Lake Chelan. I decided to get out and explore the great outdoors along the lakeshore trail. The trek started out with a very pleasant hike and went along the beautiful lake, making my journey full of oceanic views.

The path was easy to follow and the terrain was mostly flat and with very few changes. The peak of my journey was reaching a viewpoint which provided a stunning view of Lake Chelan and I had the perfect spot to rest and enjoy the sunset. I was able to complete the hiking trail in two nights and I'm very grateful to have had such an incredible experience.
