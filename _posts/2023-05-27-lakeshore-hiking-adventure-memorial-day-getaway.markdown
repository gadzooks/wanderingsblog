Memorial Day weekend is fast approaching and I'm excited to take advantage of it by exploring the Lakeshore Trail near Lake Chelan. For 3 days and 2 nights I'll be hiking the trail to take in the beauty of the area's rolling hills, shady trees, and the magnificent lake! This part of Washington State is a great place to take a holiday with its abundance of outdoor activities. I'm looking forward to the fresh air while being surrounded by nature. 

During this hiking trip I'm sure I will come across some breathtaking views. There's nothing like getting off the beaten path and discovering the beauty that comes from something as simple as a hike in the woods. I'm sure that my Memorial Day weekend will be filled with plenty of adventure and beautiful scenery.
