Memorial Day Weekend was the perfect time to explore Lake Chelan with a hiking excursion. I spent 3 days and 2 nights on the Lakeshore Trail and it ended up being one of the best trips of my life. From beachside camping to peace and quiet in the nature, I was completely enamored by the beauty and grandeur of the trail that snaked around the entire lake. With each step, I got to take in the stunning lake views and beautiful picturesque landscapes. Over the course of my journey, I also spotted plenty of wildlife that I will always remember.
