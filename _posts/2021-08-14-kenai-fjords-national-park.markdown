>You know you are in for a treat when you go whale watching in the Kenai Fjords national parks in Alaska. This was my second time in Seward and I went with the trusted [Major Marines Tours !](https://majormarine.com/){:target="_blank"}. I think we picked the 6 or 7 hour version (the longer the better I feel)

Some of the highlights of the trip were : 
- Seeing Humpback whales breaching and playing with each other
- Seeing massive glaciers up close
- Puffins, otters, bald eagles
- Amazing drinks they make off the freshly harvested ice from the glacier
