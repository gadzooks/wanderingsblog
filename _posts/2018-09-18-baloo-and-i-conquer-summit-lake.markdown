Trails in the Sky is a PSP Role-Playing game released by XSEED in 2011. It is the first game in the long-running Trails series of RPGs, and was followed by Trails in the Sky Second Chapter. It follows the story of two friends, Estelle and Joshua, as they unravel the mysteries of their country of Liberl. The game features a turn-based battle system with an ATB (Active Time Battle) system, where time is slowed down while the player makes decisions, but keeps moving if they take too long. The game also features a variety of sidequests and activities that the player can take part in. The game does have an extensive and detailed story, but the pacing can be quite slow at times, and the dungeons can be overly long and can feel like a chore to complete. The game is also very difficult at times, especially considering the limited summons and healing items that can be found. Despite this, the game is still enjoyable, and the characters and setting are unique and enjoyable. The game is worth checking out if you are a fan of traditional Japanese RPGs.
