I recently had the opportunity to go backpacking with my dog Baloo in Washington State. We decided to tackle Summit Lake, a popular backpacking destination. We had a blast! 

The hike was challenging, but with Baloo by my side, I felt confident that we could conquer it. We made it to the top of the summit and the view was breathtaking. We spent the night camping and enjoyed the peacefulness of the lake. 

The next day, we continued our journey and explored the area. We hiked through the woods and enjoyed the beauty of nature. We even spotted some wildlife! 

It was an amazing experience and I'm so glad I got to share it with my pup. Summit Lake backpacking with Baloo was an unforgettable adventure.
