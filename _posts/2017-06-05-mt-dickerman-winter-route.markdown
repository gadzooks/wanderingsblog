> [Mt Dickerman](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/mount-dickerman){:target="\_blank"} is one of the premier hikes in the Pacific North West. It is a beast of a climb but the rewards are amazing.

I decided to climb via the winter route for a change. The winter route, mainly follows the summer route but towards the top instead of taking switch-backs you go straight up as the crow flies.

This hike is not to be taken lightly, even in the best of situations and especially not in winter conditions.

Not too shabby along the way too
