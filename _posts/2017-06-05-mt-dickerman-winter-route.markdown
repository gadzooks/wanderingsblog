>[Mt Dickerman](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/mount-dickerman) is one of the premier hikes in the Pacific North West. It is a beast of a climb but the rewards are amazing. 

I decided to climb via the winter route for a change. The winter route, mainly follows the summer route but towards the top instead of taking switch-backs you go straight up as the crow flies.

This hike is not to be taken lightly, even in the best of situations and especially not in winter conditions.
