Traveling to Costa Rica was a dream come true! Our trip included a boat ride down the Rio Frio and a visit to the Cano Negro Wildlife Refuge. We saw hundreds of beautiful birds, sloths, monkeys and other animals living in their natural habitats. It was an unforgettable experience watching the wildlife from the boat. We even encountered a rare three-toed sloth near the shore! It was a great opportunity to experience some of the country's most incredible wildlife. Costa Rica is truly a paradise for bird and animal lovers alike.
