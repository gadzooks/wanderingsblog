Visiting Grand Teton National Park was one of the most grand experiences I've ever had. More than a million acres of breathtaking scenery and a wide variety of wildlife present a unique experience. The mountains tower in the sky and amazing wildlife including elk, bison, moose and more can be seen without a lengthy hike. Grand Teton is a beloved treasure in the American West and I'm grateful for the opportunity to explore its vast beauty.
