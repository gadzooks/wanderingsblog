Nothing can beat the feeling of reaching the towering peak of Everest Base Camp as the sun slowly rises in the horizon. It was the perfect time to snap a photograph of the snow covered mountains with our yak carrying the heavy hiking gear. With each step, we felt the elevation change and quickly reached 13,800 feet above sea level. It marked the highest we had ever climbed and it was a magnificently rewarding experience.
