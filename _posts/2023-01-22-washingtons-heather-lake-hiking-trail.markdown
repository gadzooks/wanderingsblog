I recently had the chance to go to Heather Lake Trail in Washington State. It was a beautiful day on January 22, 2023, with some scattered sunshine throughout the morning hours. The weather was perfect for a moderate 1.8 mile hike from the trailhead to the 10 acre lake. It was a stunning view, with the lake's water reflecting the sun and the surrounding snow-covered peaks. The trail was fairly easy, but with some steeper sections in various parts of the hike. I found it to be a great day as I took in the scenery and enjoyed some peaceful moments away from the hustle and bustle of daily life.
