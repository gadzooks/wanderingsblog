Hiking up to Artist Point is a must-do on any visit to the Pacific Northwest. The Chain Lake Trail is one of the best in the area, with breathtaking views of the snow-capped mountain ridges. Fall is especially beautiful, as the trees are bursting with colorful hues of red, orange, and yellow. Along the trail, keep your eyes peeled for ptarmigan, who make their home among the rocky ridgelines. A hike to Artist Point is definitely a highlight of any experience in Washington!
