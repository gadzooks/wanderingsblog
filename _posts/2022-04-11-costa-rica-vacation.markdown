Seeing wildlife in Costa Rica is a must-do when you visit! I found some incredible encounters with local wildlife during my stay - from the colorful birds that soar through the sky to a variety of animals like the famously slow-moving sloths and the mischievous monkeys. The best part was visiting a wildlife refuge where all of these creatures live as one giant family. It was a really special experience that I won't soon forget!
