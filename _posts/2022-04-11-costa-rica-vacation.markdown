I recently had the incredible opportunity to take a trip to Costa Rica with my family and I was absolutely blown away at all of the amazing things we got to experience! From the incredible bird watching opportunities, to seeing wild animals like monkeys, sloths, and more. It was so much fun visiting some of the wildlife refuges and seeing the various species of bird in the Costarican plane. One of my favorite parts was going out on Costa Rican night safaris to spot some of the rarest and most beautiful birds around. What a once in a lifetime experience!
