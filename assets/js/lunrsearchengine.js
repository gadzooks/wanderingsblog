The traffic is well behaved, especially once you are out of the capital San Jose. We planned our rentals in such a way that Vamos delivered the car to us on our 1st day of the rental and picked it up on the last day from a different location. This is the way to do it instead of figuring out a way to get to their office in SJ on pickup and return. San Jose to Arenal :: San Jose to Arenal: If you are coming from San Jose, it should take you no more than 3-4 hours to get to La Fortuna, Costa Rica. Traveling west on Route 1 will take you to San Ramon where you will then take Route 702 to La Fortuna. The total driving distance from La Fortuna/Arenal to San Jose is 139 km (86 miles). Although it doesn’t sound like a long distance, the winding roads will slow you down so be sure to plan accordingly. Arenal to Monte Verde :: ￼ Monte Verde to Jaco: ￼ Jaco to San Jose: ￼ "
